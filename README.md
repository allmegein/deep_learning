DEEP LEARNING

Deep learning is an artificial intelligence approach that imitates human brain to process data. Also, deep learning is a subset of machine learning method based on
artificial neural network. By means of learning deeply, algorithms can extract higher level features from the dataset and it does this with its hidden layers. 
Learning can be supervised, unsupervised or semi-supervised. Deep learning is used in solution of many problems in the machine learning field. Also, many different 
methods have been tried to develop algorithms. These learning methods such as deep neural networks, deep belief networks, recurrent neural networks, 
long-short term memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural networks are performed in computer vision, speech recognition and more fields. To mention briefly what these 
terms are:
Multi-layer neural network (MLP) consists at least one input layer, one hidden layer and one output layer. The part that provides deep learning is the hidden layer. 
In this context, MLP is the basis for deep learning.
	Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is most commonly used in computer vision. It generally uses images or videos by nature. It does the learning by examining the input 
  in depth.
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is another deep learning method that is commonly used in text and speech recognition field. It differs from multi-layer perceptron with 
feedback network term. By means of not only feedforward network but also its feedback network, it can use the past response of the hidden or output layer as an input.
Consequently, learning the MLP that underlies all of them means understanding the deep learning logic.
